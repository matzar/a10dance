  <!-- this is where the current rendering page gets swapped, meaning
  when we go to eg. roster page, all of the content from roster.page.html
  gets pasted here and gets rendered.

  Side note: html contents will change based on the eg. roster.page.ts which is
  just a script to modify the roster.page.html; to paste html elements, change their attributes and so on.

  This is going to be true for any other page, their html will get altered
  with their @Component decorated class in .ts file.
  That's why we need to pass the path to the html to `templateUrl`  - in the @Component constructor options -
  so Angular knows, which html file to alter with the methods provided in the definition of the @Component decorated class;
  html file has access to all public methods and member variables defined in its @Component decorated class.
